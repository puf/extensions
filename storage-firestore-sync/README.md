<!-- List all products the extension interacts with -->

- Cloud Functions
- Cloud Firestore
- Cloud Storage

When you use Firebase Extensions, you're only charged for the underlying resources that you use. A paid-tier billing plan is only required if the extension uses a service that requires a paid-tier plan, for example calling to a Google Cloud Platform API or making outbound network requests to non-Google services. All Firebase services offer a free tier of usage. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)

**Configuration Parameters:**

- Storage bucket: The storage bucket to monitor. Defaults to the default storage bucket of the project.

- Prefix path: The folder in the configured Cloud Storage bucket from which to synchronize the JSON files, starting with no `/` and ending in a `/`. This can be a nested folder, as long as you adhere to the Firestore nesting requirements of `/collection/document/collection/document/...`.

- Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).

**Cloud Functions:**

- **onStorageFirestoreSync:** Processes when a file has been completely written, checks if it's in the configured path, and if so: synchronized its JSON contents to Firestore.

**Access Required**:

This extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:

- firebaseauth.admin (Reason: Allows the extension to set custom claims on Firebase Auth users.)

- datastore.user (Reason: Allows the extension to write sync information back to Firestore.)
